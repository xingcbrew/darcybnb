							<p>One of the best ways to explore a new place is spending a day with locals who just happen to love their city and showing it off to visitors. Well, we love Toronto, we love meeting new people, and we want you to have the best experience possible during your time in our city. That's why we offer customized private tours catered to fit your time, interests, and budget. 
                            We can take you to visit Toronto's most iconic attractions and neighbourhoods, as well as some hidden gems around the city that visitors often don't discover on their own. We can show you places with great views of the city skyline, stop by caf√©s and shops with delicious food and snacks from around the world, enjoy the sun and local craft beer on a patio, give interesting historical/cultural accounts of neighbourhoods and buildings, and show you a great time during your visit in Toronto!</p>
                            <p>Do you enjoy being active? Great, let's go on a morning jogging tour around U of T campus or kayak to the Toronto Island! Are you a foodie? Us too. Let's eat our way around the world in Kensington Market and Chinatown. Already have some places in mind you'd like to see? Amazing - we can definitely work that into our itinerary. No idea what you where you want to go? No problemo, let's plan an awesome afternoon exploring the city together!</p>
                            <p>If you're interested in arranging a tour, please get in touch with us using the form below. </p>
